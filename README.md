# cs244_assign1
We separated our github into different branches to test the different sections on.  For section A, we used the code from the class github and only changed the window size value.  For warm-up B, our implementation of AIMD is on the branch named AIMD.  For trigger delay, our implementation is on branch TRIGGER-DELAY.  For the contest, we have a branch named contest-branch.
