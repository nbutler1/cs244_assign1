AIMD
- fixed Walter's impl to make it work better

Contest
- Idea: predict range, like Sprout
- AIMD bounces between 50% and dropping packets
- So start with AIMD and:
  - decrease division (2 -> 1.5)
  - add delay trigger
- Results: Great delay, 1Mbps throughput
- Decision: need more aggressive rampup
- Increase by 2/wsize rather than 1/wsize
- Results: 2Mbps throughput, good delay. Better!
- Try 4/wsize increase
- Results: 95% utilization (4.5 Mbps) but 1.7sec 95-percentile delay
- Try 3/wsize increase
- Results: 44% utilization (2.2) and 246ms 95-percentile delay. 9.2 power score!
  - Seems like sometimes our throughput just stays flat when the network gets
    more capacity. Why?
  - Why aren't we ramping up aggressively when the network gets more
    capacity? The delay is very low, so the trigger can't be firing.
- Try 3.25/wsize increase
- Results: 80% utilization (4.1 Mbps) and 1.2sec 95-perc delay.
  - Too aggressive.
  - Seems like rampdowns weren't aggressive enough?
  - Seems like in the first half, we don't ramp up. But in the second half,
    we aggressively use all of the capacity at the expense of delay. In the
    middle, the capacity of the network drops to 0 temporarily.
- Try bringing our threshold down to 500ms and target decrease to 40%.
  - 3.6 Mbps (72%), 750ms 95-perc. Power score about 5.
- Idea: with big window sizes, our additive increase might be overwhelming
  our threshold decrease?
- Bugfix: we were relying on two different clocks to calculate delay! Use
  roundtrip time instead.
- Bugfix: our window size was going below 1, and to infinity.
- Now we have very aggressive rampup! Let's focus on reducing delay.
  - e.g. 98% util (4.9 Mbit/s), 800ms 95-perc delay) (power score 6)
- Reduce both bounds to 100ms delay
  - 4.35 Mbit/s (86% util), 170ms 95-perc delay (power score 26!!)
- Reduce to 80ms delay
  - 3.8 Mbit/s (76% util), 150ms 95-perc delay (power score 26.30!)
- Increase rampup to 3.35/wsize increase
  - Same as before basically. Slightly less power.
  - Feels like we could use more aggressive rampup?
- Increase rampup to 3.75/wsize increase, just to see what happens.
  - Same as before basically. Slightly less power.
- Try delay thresh 100 -> 50ms for funsies.
  - Throughput went through the floor. Bad.
- Try delay thresh to 70ms.
  - 3.31Mbps (66% util), 127ms 95-perc delay (power score 26)
- Try .6 for our threshold trigger, 4/wsize for rampup
  - 3.65Mbps (72% util), 140ms 95-perc delay (power score 26.26)
- Reduce retransmission timeout to 200ms
  - 2.76Mbps (75% util), 123ms 95-perc delay (power score 30.57!!)
